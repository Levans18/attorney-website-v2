        <h1>Divorce & Dissolution</h1>
        <p> <span className="tab"></span>There are two ways to end a marriage.  If possible, dissolution is the best method where the parties agree on all marital issues and terms.  A dissolution is also quicker.  You can get a hearing on a dissolution 
          about 30 to 35 days in Stark County compared to about 3 months for an uncontested hearing date, which will turn into pretrial if an answer is filed or otherwise contested. <br/><span className="tab"></span>
Another benefit of a dissolution is cost.  Some attorneys will do them for a flat fee.  For example, I usually charge $500 for a dissolution.  The filing fee for a dissolution is $271 in Stark County while a divorce is $291. <br/><br/><span className="tab"></span>
 You can also avoid a Guardian Ad Litem being appointed with a dissolution.  If the parties cannot agree on allocation of parental rights and obligations or in other words are fighting to be named residential/custodial parent, then 
 the Court will likely appoint a GAL who will be the eyes and ears of the court.  That person will go into each parties homes and interview persons with information such as counselors or teachers or other care-givers.  The problem with the GAL 
 appointment is that each will have to pay the GAL a retainer of $750.  If that retainer is used up, each will usually be required to pay the remaining GAL attorney fees equally.  A GAL can charge over $100 per hour and 
 usually charge $150 depending on the attorney's experience. <br/><br/><span className="tab"></span>
All this can be avoided if the parties can agree on all the terms of a Separation Agreement and ask the court to incorporate it into the final decree.</p>
