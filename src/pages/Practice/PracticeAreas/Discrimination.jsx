        <p><span className="tab"></span>What are your civil rights in Ohio?  Ohio Revised Code 4112 prohibited discrimination bases on certain protected
           classes in housing, employment, and places of public accommodation.  ORC 4112.02(A) deals with unlawful employment
            discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, military status, national origin, disability, age, or ancestry.
              As a former Administrative Law Judge of the Ohio Civil Rights Commission, I am very familiar with civil rights cases
               and wrote 180 opinions for the Agency.   I understand the procedures the Ohio Civil Rights Commission and can be a great
                asset for your case.  I have enjoyed success in cases that went through the adminstrative process and those that went straight
                 to common pleas court under ORC 4112.99.  If you have any belief that you, a friend, or a loved one has been a victim of unlawful 
                 discrimination in housing, employment or in places of accommodation, give me a call or drop me an email.  I offer free consultations
                  depending on the case.</p>
