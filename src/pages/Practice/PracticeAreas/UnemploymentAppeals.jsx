        <h1>Unemployment Appeals</h1>
        <p><span className="tab"></span>Until recently, I have not had many unemployment appeals cases in the last few years.  I was very successful in getting denials reversed on appeals for clients who needed and should have
           received unemployment benefits.  I would estimate that I was successful 75% of the time.  It is important that you reach out to an attorney once your receive what is called the Director's Redetermination. 
            The next step in the appeal process is another appeal with a hearing.  They will try to push a telephone hearing on you but I have been more successful with asking for an in person hearing and requiring the employee to travel to Cleveland to defend the denial of benefits. 
            However, now with the Pandemic, every hearing is by telephone.   If you lose a telephonic hearing and then contact me, my chances of helping and getting a reversal are substantially reduced to almost no chance.  So if you or anyone else believes they have been wrongly denied
             unemployment benefits, hopefully this advise is helpful.  Feel free to pass it along.</p>
