        <h1>Landlord & Tenant</h1>
        <p> <span className="tab"></span>We have a landlord/tenant act in Ohio found in Ohio Rev. Code 5321.  I have represented both landlord and tenants.  As for landlords, I primarily handle evictions for non-payment of rent.  If someone does not pay rent, the landlord has every right to evict them.  As a landlord, if an LLC owns the property, you must use an attorney.  I offer different rates based on volume.  Please contact me for further details.<br/><br/><span className="tab"></span>
As for tenants, I have handled a number of security deposit cases where landlords have not returned any or only partial security deposits in violation of the law.  If a tenant provides a valid forwarding address and the security deposit is not returned in a timely manner, then a tenant may recover double damages, attorney's fees, and costs.  I have also handled black mold cases for landlords and tenants. <br/><br/>
